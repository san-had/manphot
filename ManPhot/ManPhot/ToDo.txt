Color index feature
-------------------
	- create a new feature branch with the name of: feature/color_index
- bug fix: in case of reset Error column has not been deleted
- when other than G selected V Cat title should be replaced for B Cat or R Cat
- star id should reflect whether G, B or R reduction
- according to the star id green colored background style should change according to the color
- in the saved record column TrG should be changed according to the color
